      <p >Once my unce and I went to visit his birth place in Germany, and it was amazing!
        among the places we went were Coblenz which happend to be right outsidethe village where he was born.
        One the most enjoyable features of traveling to Germany was how clean it was! No matter what part of 
        the country we visited the streets were not littered with trash, parking lots were kept, 
        even gas stations were near resturant quality with their dine in eateries.

      <p >Hamburg was another city went visited on our Germany tour. They have a festival there called Hamburger Dom with 
        county fair vibes, even though we didnt get a chance to attend. While there I took the opportunity to be as free spirited as possible
        here you can see be laying next to a car about the same size as me!

      <p >If I recall correctly it cost about &#8364;20 to enter the Hauptbanhoff, or the train station and ride the train. although i did
        not get the opportunity to ride the train, I did use th bathroom there which cost &#8364;2! just to use. Of course, they return your money 
        when finished but i coclude this is how Germany works to keep their country clean!
